\description{
In a contrast sensitivity figure as drawn by this function, the 
spatial frequency increases from left to right and the contrast decreases
from bottom to top.  The bars in the figure appear taller in the middle 
of the image than at the edges, creating an upside-down "U" shape, which 
is the "contrast sensitivity function".  
Your perception of this curve depends on the viewing distance.
}
\details{
What to look for:

1. Are the vertical bands visible across the full vertical axis?

2. Do the vertical bands blur together?
