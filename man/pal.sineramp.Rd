\usage{
pal.sineramp(
  pal,
  n = 150,
  nx = 512,
  ny = 256,
  amp = 12.5,
  wavelen = 8,
  pow = 2,
  main = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pal}{A palette function or a vector of colors.}

\item{n}{The number of colors to display for palette functions.}

\item{nx}{Number of 'pixels' horizontally (approximate).}

\item{ny}{Number of 'pixels' vertically}

\item{amp}{Amplitude of sine wave, default 12.5}

\item{wavelen}{Wavelength of sine wave, in pixels, default 8.}

\item{pow}{Power for dampening the sine wave. Default 2. For no dampening, use 0.
For linear dampening, use 1.}

\item{main}{Main title}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
The test image shows a sine wave superimposed on a ramp of the palette.  The
amplitude of the sine wave is dampened/modulated from full at the top
of the image to 0 at the bottom.
}
\details{
The ramp function that the sine wave is superimposed upon is adjusted slightly
for each row so that each row of the image spans the full data range of 0 to 255.
The wavelength is chosen to create a stimulus that is aligned with the
capabilities of human vision.  For the default amplitude of 12.5, the trough
to peak distance is 25, which is about 10 percent of the 256 levels of the ramp.
Some color palettes (like 'jet') have perceptual flat areas that can hide
fluctuations/features of this magnitude.

What to look for:

1. Is the sine wave equally visible horizontally across the entire image?

2. At the bottom, is the ramp smooth, or are there features like vertical bands?
